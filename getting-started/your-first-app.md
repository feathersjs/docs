# Your First App

Well alright! Let's build your first Feathers app! We're going to build a real-time chat app. It's a great way to cover all the things that you'd need to do in a real world application and all the things that Feathers provides. It also makes a lot more sense to have a real-time component than a Todo list. :wink:

If you've already gone through the [Quick Start](quick-start.md) section you can skip ahead to [#]().
