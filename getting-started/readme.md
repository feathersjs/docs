# Building Your First Feathers App

![Chat app screenshot](./assets/chat.gif)

Well alright! Let's build our first Feathers app! We're going to build a real-time chat app with [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) as the database. It's a great way to cover all the things that you'd need to do in a real world application and how Feathers can help. It also makes a lot more sense to have a real-time component than a Todo list. 😉

In this tutorial you go from nothing to a real-time chat app complete with signup, login, token based authentication, authorization, with a RESTful API and a working front-end. [Let's get started](./scaffolding.md).

You can find a complete working example [here](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat).
