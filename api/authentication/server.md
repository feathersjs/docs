$ npm install feathers-authentication --save
```

The [feathers-authentication](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication) module assists in using JWT for authentication.  It has three primary purposes:

1. Setup an `/authentication` endpoint to create JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT are used as access tokens. (learn more about JWT at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io))
2. Provide a consistent authentication API for all of the Feathers transports: feathers-rest, feathers-socketio, and feathers-primus.
3. Provide a framework for authentication plugins that use [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategies to protect endpoints.

## Complementary Plugins

The following plugins are complementary, but entirely optional:

- [feathers-authentication-client](./client.md)
- [feathers-authentication-local](./local.md)
- [feathers-authentication-jwt](./jwt.md)
- [feathers-authentication-oauth1](./oauth1.md)
- [feathers-authentication-oauth2](./oauth2.md)

**For the auth middleware to work as expected, the plugins must be configured before creating any services.**

## API

This module contains:

1. [The main entry function](#configuration)
2. [The `/authentication` service](#the-authentication-service)
3. [The `authenticate` hook](#the-authenticate-hook)
4. [Authentication Events](#authentication-events)
5. [Express middleware](#express-middleware)
6. A [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) adapter for Feathers

## Configuration
### `app.configure(auth(options))`
Setup is done the same as all Feathers plugins, using the `configure` method:

```js
const auth = require('feathers-authentication');

// Available options are listed in the "Default Options" section
app.configure(auth(options))
```

## Default `options`

The following default options will be mixed in with your global `auth` object from your config file. It will set the mixed options back on to the app so that they are available at any time by calling `app.get('auth')`. They can all be overridden and are required by some of the authentication plugins.

```js
{
  path: '/authentication', // the authentication service path
  header: 'Authorization', // the header to use when using JWT auth
  entity: 'user', // the entity that will be added to the request, socket, and hook.params. (ie. req.user, socket.user, hook.params.user)
  service: 'users', // the service to look up the entity
  passReqToCallback: true, // whether the request object should be passed to the strategies `verify` function
  session: false, // whether to use sessions
  cookie: {
    enabled: false, // whether cookie creation is enabled
    name: 'feathers-jwt', // the cookie name
    httpOnly: false, // when enabled, prevents the client from reading the cookie.
    secure: true // whether cookies should only be available over HTTPS
  },
  jwt: {
    header: { type: 'access' }, // by default is an access token but can be any type
    audience: 'https://yourdomain.com', // The resource server where the token is processed
    subject: 'anonymous', // Typically the entity id associated with the JWT
    issuer: 'feathers', // The issuing server, application or resource
    algorithm: 'HS256', // the algorithm to use
    expiresIn: '1d' // the access token expiry
  }
}
```

## Additional `app` methods
The Feathers `app` will contain two useful methods once you've configured the auth plugin:
- [app.passport.createJWT](#apppassportcreatejwtpayload-options--promise-source)
- [app.passport.verifyJWT](#apppassportverifyjwttoken-options-source)

### `app.passport.createJWT(payload, options) => promise` [source](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication/blob/master/src/utils.js#L8)
This is the method used by the `/authentication` service to generate JSON Web Tokens.
- `payload {Object}` - becomes the JWT payload. Will also include an `exp` property denoting the expiry timestamp.
- `options {Object}` - the options passed to [jsonwebtoken `sign()`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken#jwtsignpayload-secretorprivatekey-options-callback)
  - `secret {String | Buffer}` - either the secret for HMAC algorithms, or the PEM encoded private key for RSA and ECDSA.
  - `jwt` - See the [`jsonwebtoken`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken#jwtsignpayload-secretorprivatekey-options-callback) package docs for other available options. The authenticate method uses the [default `jwt` options](#default-options). When using this package, directly, they will have to be passed in manually.

The returned `promise` resolves with the JWT or fails with an error.

### `app.passport.verifyJWT(token, options)` [source](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication/blob/master/src/utils.js#L48)
Verifies the signature and payload of the passed in JWT `token` using the `options`.
- `token {JWT}` - the JWT to be verified.
- `options {Object}` the options passed to [jsonwebtoken `verify()`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback)
  - `secret {String | Buffer}` - - either the secret for HMAC algorithms, or the PEM encoded private key for RSA and ECDSA.
  - See the [`jsonwebtoken`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken#jwtsignpayload-secretorprivatekey-options-callback) package docs for other available options.

The returned `promise` resolves with the payload or fails with an error.

## The `authentication` service
The heart of this plugin is simply a service for creating JWT.  It's a normal Feathers service that implements only the `create` and `remove` methods.  The `/authentication` service provides all of the functionality that the `/auth/local` and `/auth/token` endpoints did.  To choose a strategy, the client must pass the `strategy` name in the request body.  This will be different based on the plugin used.  See the documentation for the plugins listed at the top of this page for more information.

### `app.service('/authentication').create(data, params)`

The `create` method will be used in nearly every Feathers application.  It creates a JWT based on the `jwt` options configured on the plugin.  The API of this method utilizes the `hook` object:

#### `before` hook API:
These properties can be modified to change the behavior of the `/authentication` service.
- `hook.data.payload {Object}` - determines the payload of the JWT
- `hook.params.payload {Object}` - also determines the payload of the JWT. Any matching attributes in the `hook.data.payload` will be overwritten by these. Persists into after hooks.
- `hook.params.authenticated {Boolean}` - After successful authentication, will be set to `true`, unless it's set to `false` in a before hook.  If you set it to `false` in a before hook, it will prevent the websocket from being flagged as authenticated. Persists into after hooks.

#### `after` hook API:
- `hook.params[entity] {Object}` - After successful authentication, the `entity` looked up from the database will be populated here. (The default option is `user`.)

### `app.service('/authentication').remove(data)`

The `remove` method will be used less often.  It mostly exists to allow for adding hooks the the "logout" process.  For example, in services that require high control over security, a developer could register hooks on the `remove` method that perform token blacklisting.

#### `after` hook API:
- `hook.result {Object}` - After logout, useful information regarding the previous session will be populated here.

Below is the example of the hook usage:
```javascript
    after: {
      remove: [
        function (hook) {
          return app.passport.verifyJWT(hook.result.accessToken, { secret: app.passport.options('jwt').secret })
              .then((data) => {
                // removing the user who decided to logout
                app.service('users').remove(data.userId).then(() => {
                  return hook;
                });
              });
        }
      ]
    }
```

## The `authenticate` hook

`auth.hooks.authenticate(strategies)`, where `strategies` is an array of passport strategy names.

`feathers-authentication` only includes a single hook. This bundled `authenticate` hook is used to register an array of authentication strategies on a service method.  When authenticating, the client must send the `strategy` as part of the payload.

> **Note:** This should usually be used on your `/authentication` service. Without it you can hit the `authentication` service and generate a JWT `accessToken` without authentication (ie. anonymous authentication).

```js
app.service('authentication').hooks({
  before: {
    create: [
      // You can chain multiple strategies
      auth.hooks.authenticate(['jwt', 'local']),
    ],
    remove: [
      auth.hooks.authenticate('jwt')
    ]
  }
});
```

The hooks that were once bundled with this module are now located at [feathers-authentication-hooks](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication-hooks).

## Authentication Events

The `login` and `logout` events are emitted on the `app` object whenever a client successfully authenticates or "logs out". (With JWT, logging out doesn't invalidate the JWT.  Read the section about how JWT work for more information.) These events are only emitted on the server.

### `app.on('login', callback))` and `app.on('logout', callback))`

These two events use a callback with the same signature.

- `callback` {Function} - a function in the format `function (result, meta) {}`.

  - `result` {Object} - The final `hook.result` from the `authentication` service. Unless you customize the `hook.response` in an after hook, this will only contain the `accessToken`, which is the JWT.
  - `meta` {Object} - information about the request.  *The `meta` data varies per transport / provider as follows.*
    - Using `feathers-rest`
      - `provider` {String} - will always be `"rest"`
      - `req` {Object} - the Express request object.
      - `res` {Object} - the Express response object.
    - Using `feathers-socketio` and `feathers-primus`:
      - `provider` {String} - the transport name: `socketio` or `primus`
      - `connection` {Object} - the same as `params` in the hook context
      - `socket` {SocketObject} - the current user's WebSocket object.  It also contains the `feathers` attribute, which is the same as `params` in the hook context.


## Express Middleware

There is an `authenticate` middleware. It is used the exact same way you would the regular Passport express middleware:

```js
app.post('/login', auth.express.authenticate('local', { successRedirect: '/app', failureRedirect: '/login' }));
```

Additional middleware are included and exposed but typically you don't need to worry about them:

- `emitEvents` [source](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication/blob/master/src/express/emit-events.js) - emit `login` and `logout` events
- `exposeCookies` [source](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication/blob/master/src/express/expose-cookies.js) - expose cookies to Feathers so they are available to hooks and services.  **This is NOT used by default as its use exposes your API to CSRF vulnerabilities.**  Only use it if you really know what you're doing.
- `exposeHeaders` [source](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication/blob/master/src/express/expose-headers.js) - expose headers to Feathers so they are available to hooks and services. **This is NOT used by default as its use exposes your API to CSRF vulnerabilities.** Only use it if you really know what you're doing.
- `failureRedirect` [source](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication/blob/master/src/express/failure-redirect.js) - support redirecting on auth failure. Only triggered if `hook.redirect` is set.
- `successRedirect` [source](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication/blob/master/src/express/success-redirect.js) - support redirecting on auth success. Only triggered if `hook.redirect` is set.
- `setCookie` [source](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication/blob/master/src/express/set-cookie.js) - support setting the JWT access token in a cookie. Only enabled if cookies are enabled.  **Note: Feathers will NOT read an access token from a cookie.  This would expose the API to CSRF attacks.**  This `setCookie` feature is available primarily for helping with Server Side Rendering.

## Migrating to 1.x
Refer to [the migration guide](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication/blob/master/docs/migrating.md).

## Complete Example
Here's an example of a Feathers server that uses `feathers-authentication` for local auth. You can try it out on your own machine by running the [example](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication/tree/master/example)

**For the auth middleware to work as expected, the plugins must be configured before creating any services.**

```js
const feathers = require('@feathersjs/feathers');
const rest = require('@feathersjs/express/rest');
const socketio = require('@feathersjs/socketio');
const hooks = require('feathers-hooks');
const memory = require('feathers-memory');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const errors = require('@feathersjs/errors');
const errorHandler = require('@feathersjs/errors/handler');
const local = require('feathers-authentication-local');
const jwt = require('feathers-authentication-jwt');
const auth = require('feathers-authentication');

const app = feathers();
app.configure(rest())
  .configure(socketio())
  .configure(hooks())
  .use(bodyParser.json())
  .use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }))
  .configure(auth({ secret: 'supersecret' }))
  .configure(local())
  .configure(jwt())
  .use('/users', memory())
  .use('/', feathers.static(__dirname + '/public'))
  .use(errorHandler());

app.service('authentication').hooks({
  before: {
    create: [
      // You can chain multiple strategies
      auth.hooks.authenticate(['jwt', 'local'])
    ],
    remove: [
      auth.hooks.authenticate('jwt')
    ]
  }
});

// Add a hook to the user service that automatically replaces
// the password with a hash of the password before saving it.
app.service('users').hooks({
  before: {
    find: [
      auth.hooks.authenticate('jwt')
    ],
    create: [
      local.hooks.hashPassword({ passwordField: 'password' })
    ]
  }
});

const port = 3030;
let server = app.listen(port);
server.on('listening', function() {
  console.log(`Feathers application started on localhost:${port}`);
});
```
