# Realtime-1

> Examples of realtime replication for an entire file

The contents of a remote service may be copied to a client service.
The records in that client service may then be kept current
using the realtime events emitted by the remote service.

All the data, or that part of the data satisfying a query may be copied.
- This example uses all the data.

## Running the example

See README in `examples/` folder.
