# Snapshot

> Examples of snapshots

The client may copy data from a remote service.
- All the data, or that part of the data satisfying a query may be copied.
- `snapshot.readService` resolves to the data.
- `snapshot.copyService` copies the data to another service (usually) local to the client.

## Running the example

See README in `examples/` folder.
