# Middleware

In the previous chapter we learned about how [Hooks](../hooks/readme.md) are used as data-oriented middleware for services.

A slightly different kind of middleware is one of the key concepts behind Express and since Feathers just extends Express, it can use all existing Express middleware and features.

In this chapter we will look at how [services and Express middleware](express.md) play together and how [routing and versioning](routing.md) works for Feathers APIs.
