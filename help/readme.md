# Help!

There are many ways that you can get help but before you explore them please check the other parts of these docs, the [FAQ](../faq/readme.md), [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/feathersjs), [Github Issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Afeathersjs+) and our [Medium publication](https://blog.feathersjs.com/).

If none of those work it's a very real possibility that we screwed something up or it's just not clear. We're sorry ðŸ˜¥. We want to hear about it and are very friendly so feel free to come talk to us in [Slack](http://slack.feathersjs.com/), [submit your issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/issues/new) on Github or ask on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) using the [feathersjs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/feathersjs) tag.
