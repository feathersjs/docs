# Help!

There are many ways that you can get help but before you explore them please check other parts of this guide, the [FAQ](faq.md), [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/feathersjs), [Github Issues](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/issues) and our Medium publication ["All About FeathersJS"](https://medium.com/all-about-feathersjs).

If none of those work it's a very real possibility that we screwed something up or it's just not clear. We're sorry ðŸ˜¥. We want to hear about it and are very friendly so feel free to come talk to us in [Slack](http://slack.feathersjs.com/), [submit your issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/issues/new) on Github or ask on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) using the [feathersjs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/feathersjs) tag.
