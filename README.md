> An open source REST and realtime API layer for modern applications.

Feathers is _a batteries included but entirely optional_ minimal web application framework.

At it's core, it's a set of tools and an architecture pattern that make it easy to create scalable REST APIs and real-time applications. With Feathers, you can literally build prototypes in minutes and production-ready apps in days.

Feathers achieves this by being the glue code between some amazing battle tested open source technologies - adding a few minimal abstractions and introducing an application architecture that is easier to understand, maintain, and scale than the traditional MVC architecture.
