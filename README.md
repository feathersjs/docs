> An open source REST and realtime API layer for modern applications.

Feathers is a set of tools and an architecture pattern that makes it easy to create scalable REST APIs and real-time applications.You can literally build prototypes in minutes and production ready applications in days.

Feathers achieves this by being the glue code between some amazing battle tested open source technologies and adding a few core pieces like [Hooks](../../api/hooks.md) and [Services](../../api/services.md) that encourage an easier to understand and more scalable application architecture.
