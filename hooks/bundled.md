# Built-in hooks

When it makes sense to do so, some plug-ins include their own hooks. The following plug-ins come bundled with useful hooks:

- `feathers-hooks` (see below)
- [`feathers-mongoose`](../databases/mongoose.md)
- [`feathers-authentication`](../authorization/bundled-hooks.md)

There are a few hooks included in the `feathers-hooks` module that are available on the hooks module.

## Populate

`populate(fieldName, { service: service, field: sourceField })`

The `populate` after hook uses a property from the result (or every item if it is a list) to retrieve a single related entry from a service.

```js
const hooks = require('feathers-hooks');

// Given a `user_id` in a message, retrieve the user and
// add it in the `user` field.
app.service('messages').after(hooks.populate('user', {
  service: 'users',
  field: 'user_id'  
}));
```

## Disable

`disable(providers|callback)`

Disable access to a service method completely or for a specific provider. All providers ([REST](../rest/readme.md), [Socket.io](../real-time/socket-io.md) and [Primus](../real-time/primus.md)) set the `params.provider` property which is what `disable` checks for. There are several ways to use the disable hook:

- `disable()` will disable the service method completely
- `disable('rest')` will disable the method for the REST provider
- `disable('external')` will disable access from all providers making a service method only usable internally.
- `disable(function(hook) {})` will run the function with the hook object. It should return a boolean value or a promise that resolves with a boolean.

```js
const hooks = require('feathers-hooks');

app.service('users').before({
  // Users can not be created by external access
  create: hooks.disable('external'),
  // A user can not be deleted through the REST provider
  remove: hooks.disable('rest'),
  // Disable calling `update` completely (e.g. to only support `patch`)
  update: hooks.disable(),
  // Disable the remove hook if the user is not an admin
  remove: hooks.disable(function(hook) {
    if(!hook.params.user.isAdmin) {
      return false;
    }

    return true;
  })
});
```

> **ProTip:** Service methods that are not implemented do not need to be disabled.

## Remove

`remove(fields)`

Remove the given fields either from the data submitted (as a `before` hook for `create`, `update` or `patch`) or from the result (as an `after` hook). If the data is an array or a paginated `find` result the hook will remove the field for every item.

```js
const hooks = require('feathers-hooks');

// Remove the hashed `password` and `salt` field after all method calls
app.service('users').after(hooks.remove('password', 'salt'));

// Remove _id for `create`, `update` and `patch`
app.service('users').before({
  create: hooks.remove('_id'),
  update: hooks.remove('_id'),
  patch: hooks.remove('_id')
})
```

## Lowercase

`lowerCase(fields)`

Lowercase the given fields either in the data submitted (as a `before` hook for `create`, `update` or `patch`) or in the result (as an `after` hook). If the data is an array or a paginated `find` result the hook will lowercase the field for every item.

```js
const hooks = require('feathers-hooks');

// lowercase the `email` and `password` field before a user is created
app.service('users').before({
  create: hooks.lowerCase('email', 'username')
});
```
