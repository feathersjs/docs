# The Feathers Generator (CLI)

In the [basics guide](../basics/readme.md) we learned about Feathers by writing all code in a single file by hand. Because Feathers is very flexible and modular you could just continue writing all your application code that way.

The Feathers CLI provides a generator that initializes a server side Feathers application with a recommended application structure. This guide will show how to install and use the generator and discuss the file structure and commonly used patterns in the generated application.
