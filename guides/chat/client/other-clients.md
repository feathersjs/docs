# Chat clients for other frameworks

You can [look at chat clients](https://docs.feathersjs.com/getting-started/frontend.html)
written using several different frameworks.
These clients were written for a
[slightly different Feathers chat server](https://docs.feathersjs.com/getting-started/readme.html),
but they clearly indicate how to integrate Feathers with different frameworks.

### Is anything wrong, unclear, missing?
