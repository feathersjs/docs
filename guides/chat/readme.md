# Creating a Chat Application

Well alright! Let's build our first Feathers app! We're going to build a real-time chat app with [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) as the database. It's a great way to cover all the things that you'd need to do in a real world application and how Feathers can help. It also makes a lot more sense to have a real-time component than a Todo list. ðŸ˜‰
