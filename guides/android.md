# Feathers + Android

We haven't had time to publish this guide yet. If you feel like you could contribute one feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-docs/edit/master/guides/android.md).

An official Feathers client does not exist yet. We have set up a placeholder for it so if you feel like contributing head over to the [feathers-android repo](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-android).
