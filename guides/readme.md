## The Feathers guide

The Feathers guide will walk you through all the important parts of Feathers. The [quick start](./basics/starting.md) gets you up and running with a Feathers REST API and real-time website from scratch in less than 15 minutes to give you an idea what Feathers is about.

In the next part we will [generate an application](./basics/generator.md) and then walk through Feathers core concepts like services, hooks and authentication by building a complete real-time chat application with a REST API and a website that can register users and send and receive messages in real-time. We will also add a login with GitHub and write unit tests for our API.
