# Services

Services are the heart of every Feathers application and JavaScript objects (or instances of [ES6 classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)) that implements [certain methods](#service-methods). Feathers itself will also add some [additional methods and functionality](#feathers-functionality) to its services.

## Service methods

Service methods are pre-defined [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) methods that your service object can implement (or that has already been implemented by one of the [database adapters](./databases/common.md)).
