# Databases

In the [services chapter](./services.md) we created a custom in-memory messages service that can create, update and delete messages. You can probably imagine how we could implement the same thing using a database instead of storing the messages in memory so there isn't really a database that Feathers doesn't support.

Writing all that code yourself is pretty repetitive and cumbersome though which is why Feathers has a collection of pre-built services for different databases. They offer most the basic functionality and can always be fully customized to your requirements using [hooks](./hooks.md). Feathers database adapters support a common [usage API](../../api/databases/common.md), pagination and [querying syntax](../../api/databases/querying.md) for many popular databases and NodeJS ORMs:

| Database | Adapter |
|---|---|
| In memory | [feathers-memory](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-memory), [feathers-nedb](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-nedb) |
| Localstorage, AsyncStorage | [feathers-localstorage](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-localstorage) |
| Filesystem | [feathers-nedb](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-nedb) |
| MongoDB | [feathers-mongodb](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-mongodb), [feathers-mongoose](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-mongoose) |
| MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MSSQL | [feathers-knex](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-knex), [feathers-sequelize](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-sequelize) |
| Elasticsearch | [feathers-elasticsearch](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-elasticsearch) |
| RethinkDB | [feathers-rethinkdb](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-rethinkdb) |

> __Pro tip:__ Each one of the linked adapters has a complete REST API example in their readme.

In this chapter we will look at the basic usage of the in-memory database adapter.

> __Important:__ You should be familiar with the database technology and ORM ([Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/), [KnexJS](http://knexjs.org/) or [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)) before using a Feathers database adapter.

## An in-memory database

[feathers-memory](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-memory) is a Feathers database adapter that - similar to our messages service - stores its data in memory. We will use it for the examples because it also works in the browser. Let's install it with:

```
npm install feathers-memory --save
```

We can use the adapter by requiring it and initializing it with the options we want. Here we enable pagination showing 10 entries by default and a maximum of 25 (so that clients can't just request all data at once and crash our server):

```js
const feathers = require('@feathersjs/feathers');
const memory = require('feathers-memory');

const app = feathers();

app.use('messages', memory({
  paginate: {
    default: 10,
    max: 25
  }
}));
```

That's it. We have a complete CRUD service for our messages with querying functionality.

## In the browser

We can also include `feathers-memory` in the browser, most easily by loading its browser build which will add it as `feathers.memory`. In `public/index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Feathers Basics</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Feathers</h1>
  <p>Open up the console in your browser.</p>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="//unpkg.com/@feathersjs/client@^3.0.0/dist/feathers.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="//unpkg.com/feathers-memory@^2.0.0/dist/feathers-memory.js"></script>
  <script src="client.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

And `public/client.js`:

```js
const app = feathers();

app.use('messages', feathers.memory({
  paginate: {
    default: 10,
    max: 25
  }
}));
```

## Querying

As mentioned, all database adapters support a common way of querying the data in a `find` method call using `params.query`. You can find a complete list in the [querying syntax API](../../api/databases/querying.md).

With pagination enabled, the `find` method will return an object with the following properties:

- `data` - The current list of data
- `limit` - The page size
- `skip` - The number of entries that were skipped
- `total` - The total number of entries for this query

The following example automatically creates 100 messages and makes some queries. You can add it at the end of both `app.js` and `public/client.js` to see it in Node and the browser:

```js
async function createAndFind() {
  // Stores a reference to the messages service so we don't have to call it all the time
  const messages = app.service('messages');

  for(let counter = 0; counter < 100; counter++) {
    await messages.create({
      counter,
      message: `Message number ${counter}`
    });
  }

  // We show 10 entries by default. By skipping 10 we go to page 2
  const page2 = await messages.find({
    query: { $skip: 10 }
  });

  console.log('Page number 2', page2);

  // Show 20 items per page
  const largePage = await messages.find({
    query: { $limit: 20 }
  });

  console.log('20 items', largePage);

  // Find the first 10 items with counter greater 50 and less than 70
  const counterList = await messages.find({
    query: {
      counter: { $gt: 50, $lt: 70 }
    }
  });

  console.log('Counter greater 50 and less than 70', counterList);

  // Find all entries with text "Message number 20"
  const message20 = await messages.find({
    query: {
      message: 'Message number 20'
    }
  });

  console.log('Entries with text "Message number 20"', message20);
}

createAndFind();
```

## As a REST API

In the [REST API chapter](./rest.md) we created a REST API from our custom messages service. Using a database adapter instead will make our `app.js` a lot shorter:

```js
const feathers = require('@feathersjs/feathers');
const express = require('@feathersjs/express');
const memory = require('feathers-memory');

const app = express(feathers());

// Turn on JSON body parsing for REST services
app.use(express.json())
// Turn on URL-encoded body parsing for REST services
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
// Set up REST transport using Express
app.configure(express.rest());

// Initialize the messages service
app.use('messages', memory({
  paginate: {
    default: 10,
    max: 25
  }
}));

// Set up an error handler that gives us nicer errors
app.use(express.errorHandler());

// Start the server on port 3030
const server = app.listen(3030);

// Use the service to create a new message on the server
app.service('messages').create({
  text: 'Hello from the server'
});

server.on('listening', () => console.log('Feathers REST API started at localhost:3030'));
```

After starting the server with `node app.js` we can pass a query e.g. by going to [localhost:3030/messages?$limit=2](http://localhost:3030/messages?$limit=2).

> __Note:__ The [querying syntax API documentation](../../api/databases/querying.md) has more examples how URLs should look like.

## What's next?

Feathers database adapters are a quick way to get an API and up and running. The great thing is that [hooks](./hooks.md) still give us all the flexibility we need to customize how they work. We already saw how we can easily create a database backed REST API, in the [next chapter](./real-time.md) we will make our API real-time.
