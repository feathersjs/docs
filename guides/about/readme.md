# Why Feathers

If you went through [the tutorial](../getting-started/readme.md) you probably saw just how quick it is to get an application off the ground. 

Using Feathers is quite simply the fastest way to build scalable, real-time web and mobile applications. You can literally build prototypes in minutes and production ready applications in days. Feathers achieves this by being a thin wrapper over top of some amazing battle tested open source technologies and adding a few core pieces like [Hooks](../../api/hooks.md) and [Services](../../api/services.md).

If you've decided that Feathers might be for you and you haven't tried the tutorial, feel free to dive right in and [learn about the basics](../step-by-step/readme.md). If you're still unsure about what Feathers does and where it comes from you can learn more about the [Feathers philosophy](./philosophy.md), see [what Feathers offers](./features.md) or check out [how Feathers compares to others](./vs.md).
