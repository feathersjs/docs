# What next?

We've accomplished a lot.

We've learned Feathers is transport agnostic.
A Feathers server automatically handles requests from
- HTTP REST clients,
- Feathers REST clients, or
- Feathers WebSocket clients.

We've learned Feathers resource management is platform agnostic.
Identical database calls may be made on the server and on the frontend.
- This makes frontend development **significantly** easier.
- It allows you to share code between the server and the frontend.

We've likely experienced Feathers **a-ha!** moment.

We have a solid understanding of basic Feathers.
Our strong foundation will allow us to explore new Feathers features.

We not only learned how to generate the scaffolding for an app and how to add a service,
but we understand what that scaffolding does.

Where do we go from here? Our recommendation are:

- Read the next guide [Writing a Chat Room App](chat/readme.md).
- Read the how to
[write client front-ends](https://docs.feathersjs.com/v/auk/getting-started/frontend.html)
for a similar chat room app.
- Join the [Feathers slack community](https://feathersjs.slack.com/messages/general/).
The #general, #help and #suggestion channels will be helpful.
- Wait for more guides to be published.

And don't be shy, speak to us on **slack**. We're there to help.
