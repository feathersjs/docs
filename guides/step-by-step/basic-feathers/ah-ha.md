# The Feathers **"ah-ha"** moment

## Feathers is transport agnostic

A Feathers server automatically handles requests from
- HTTP REST clients,
- Feathers REST clients, or
- Feathers WebSocket clients.

## Feathers resource management is platform agnostic

Identical database calls may be made on the server and on the frontend
without you needing to do anything.
- This makes frontend development **significantly** easier.
- It allows you to share code between the server and the frontend.

## The **"ah-ha"** moment

The "ah-ha" moment comes when you start to realize the significance of these features.
Enormous amounts of boilerplate simply disappear.

> You might now start to appreciate why people are enthusiastic about Feathers.
