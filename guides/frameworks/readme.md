# Integrating with Frontend Frameworks

Feathers works the same on the server and on the client and is front-end framework agnostic! You can use it with Vue, React, React Native, Angular, or whatever other front-end tech stack you choose.

## Client Side Docs

If you want to learn how to use Feathers as a client in Node.js, React Native, or in the browser with a module loader like Webpack refer to the [client API docs](/api/client.md).

## Examples

The [Feathers Chat application](../chat/readme.md) guide gives a basic intro to using the Feathers Client in a vanilla JavaScript environment. That's a good place to start so you can see how simple it is.

Beyond the basics, see [this list](https://github.com/feathersjs/awesome-feathersjs#examples) of Feathers examples in [awesome-feathersjs](https://github.com/feathersjs/awesome-feathersjs).

## Framework Integrations

See [this list](https://github.com/feathersjs/awesome-feathersjs#js-clients) of Feathers front-end framework integrations if you are looking for something that makes Feathers even easier to use with things like React, Vue or others.
