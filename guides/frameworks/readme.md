# Integrating with Frontend Frameworks

Feathers is front-end framework agnostic! You can use with Vue, React, React Native, Angular, or whatever other front-end tech stack you choose.

## Client Side Docs

If you want to learn how to Feathers as a client in Node.js, React Native, or in the browser with a module loader like Webpack refer to the [client API docs](/api/client.md).

## Examples

The [Feathers Chat application](../chat/readme.md) guide gives a basic intro to using the Feathers Client with vanilla JavaScript. That's a good place to start.
